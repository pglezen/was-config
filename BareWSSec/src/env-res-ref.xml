An 
<firstterm>environment resource reference</firstterm>
allows a provider to organize a set of environment properties
for customizing parts of the application infrastructure.
It's analogous to a datasource, which provides a set of
properties to be configured for each target database
instance.  An environment resource reference is more general;
it allows a user-defined set of properties to be defined
by a user-defined class.  Then multiple sets of these 
properties can configured into JNDI for look-up by applications.

Configuring JAX-WS endpoints for managed JAX-WS clients is
a good application of this technique.  The up-front 
programming work
involves defining the required 
JNDI SPI (service provider interface)
implementation and packaging it as a shared library for
the relying applications.
