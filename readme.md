==========

I use this repository to source control documents I generate
from working with WebSphere Application Server (WAS).  I have
quite a backlog of topics to document.  My plan is to document
small focused topics at a time.  This way I can combine them
as needed into larger topics or standalone.

I enter the document source in [DocBook](http://docbook.org)
format and render the output using DocBook stylesheets.  You
do not have to understand DocBook to review content or even
to suggest changes.  The XML input files for DocBook are
easy to understand when you see one.  But if you wish to
render DocBook output yourself, I would suggest an
[Eclipse-based set-up](http://pglezen.github.io/DocBookEclipse).
However, there are many other ways of setting up your own
DocBook environment documented in the
[DocBook Complete Guide](http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/index.html).
